Gen 606 Phylogenetics Exercise
--

The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize you with the very basics of phylogenetic methods. There are a number of courses that expand upon this both at UNH and beyond. There are also some great tutorials that might be interesting for some: http://treethinkers.org/tutorials/

**Steps for analysis**

- Navigate to http://phylogeny.lirmm.fr/phylo_cgi/phylogeny.cgi

- Click Phylogeny Analysis > "a la carte"

**Set up your Analysis**

- name your pipeline

- Check Multiple Alignment, Alignment Curation, Construction of Phylogenetic Tree, Visualization
	- Alignment > MUSCLE
	- Curation > GBLOCKS
	- Tree > PhyML
	- Visualization - TreeDyn

- At the bottom of the page, check Run Work Flow > Step by Step. 

- Click Create workflow

- Paste in your nucleotide sequences, then click submit

**Generating Results**

- Alignment

	- What do the different colors mean?
	- Can you infer something about the relationship between the species based on this alignment?
	- Optional - download the alignment.
	- when done, scroll to bottom of page and click "Next Step"
	

- Curation

	- Click option under 'For a more stringent selection' > Submit

	- What did curation do?
	- Why might this be important? 
	- when done, scroll to bottom of page and click "Next Step"

- PhyML Tree Building
	- There are numerous settings for Phylogeny building. For now, lets just leave to the default. 
	- Click Submit
	- Once done, click "Next Step"

- Tree Visualization
	- Submit
	- What does phylogeny mean?
	- Red numbers?
	- Why different branch lengths?
	-

- Check Multiple Alignment, Alignment Curation, Construction of Phylogenetic Tree, Visualization
	- Within each of these blocks, choose one of the options. Hopefully people will choose different options, which might lead to different results.
