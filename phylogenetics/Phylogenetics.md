Gen 606 Phylogenetics Exercise
--

The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize you with the very basics of phylogenetic methods. There are a number of courses that expand upon this both at UNH and beyond. There are also some great tutorials that might be interesting for some: http://treethinkers.org/tutorials/

**Steps for analysis**

- Navigate to http://phylogeny.lirmm.fr/phylo_cgi/phylogeny.cgi

- Click Phylogeny Analysis > "a la carte"

**Set up your Analysis**

- name your pipeline

- Check Multiple Alignment, Alignment Curation, Construction of Phylogenetic Tree, Visualization
	- Alignment > MUSCLE
	- Curation > GBLOCKS
	- Tree > PhyML
	- Visualization - TreeDyn

- At the bottom of the page, check Run Work Flow > Step by Step. 

- Click Create workflow

- Paste in your nucleotide sequences, then click submit

- Check Multiple Alignment, Alignment Curation, Construction of Phylogenetic Tree, Visualization
	- Within each of these blocks, choose one of the options. Hopefully people will choose different options, which might lead to different results.
